    <h1>
      Effect trigger cutscene
    </h1>
    <p>
      Through this effect a cutscene is triggered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Create a trigger cutscene effect:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Select the effect: </b>Select the effect on the creation effects 
        panel. Press OK.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Creation effect panel: </b>afterwards the next panel will appear:<img style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 10px; display: block; margin-bottom: 10px" src="Effects_Cutscene_files/Cutscene_effect_ES.jpg" alt="CUTSCENE EFFECT.JPG fail!">
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We can choose among the cutscenes of the chapter. It is noticeable that 
      once the cutscene ends the effects and the switches of the scene 
      associated are executed. Once the associated cutscene effects are over 
      they will continue executing the other effects in order. That is, 
      although the fact of launching an object triggers other indirect 
      effects, this does not involve cutting the flow of the effects expected 
      to be launched.
    </p>
    <b>Example:</b> We have the following effects asociated to watch an 
    object::

    <ol>
      <li>
        Launch cutscene &quot;XXXX&quot;, which has the following associated effect:

        <ol>
          <li>
            Player says: &quot;First comment&quot;
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Player says: &quot;Second comment&quot;
      </li>
    </ol>
    Effects will execute in this order:: 1 Launch cutscene; 2Player says: 
    &quot;First comment&quot;; 3 Player says: &quot;Second comment&quot;
  </body>
