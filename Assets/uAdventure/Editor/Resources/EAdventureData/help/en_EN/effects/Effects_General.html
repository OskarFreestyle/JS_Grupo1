      Effects
    </h1>
    <p>
      In order to control the state of the game we use flags, variables and 
      global states. They are used to add some conditions to elements of the 
      games dependending on the actual value. On this way we define concrete 
      situations in the games, specifying what must appears on the scene, 
      which actions we might be able to perform, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the effects we can change the state of the flags and variables, 
      modifying the concrete states in the game. This happens because the 
      changes on some flags and variables allow changing conditions. We can 
      find those effects on the &quot;Game State&quot; group.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, we can find the next effects groups:
    </p>
    <ul>
