    <h1>
      Effect move character
    </h1>
    <p>
      Through this effect we will be able to move the selected character to 
      the selected position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Create a move character effect:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Select the effect: </b>Select the effect on the creation effects 
        panel. Press OK.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Creation effect panel: </b>afterwards the next panel will appear:
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place we can move the selected character. Afterwards we can 
      select a scene from the chapter. As with other effects, the selection of 
      the scene has the only purpose of preview, because the effect does not 
      need to be related to the scene shown.
    </p>
    <p>
      The movement of the character will be executed in the scene where this 
      effect is triggered. Once you have chosen the scene, you choose the 
      position that the character will move, either filling in the X and Y 
      coordinates or by clicking on the chosen position on the stage
