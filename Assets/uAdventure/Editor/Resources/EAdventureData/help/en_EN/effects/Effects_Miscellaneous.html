      Miscelanea effects
    </h1>
    <p>
      In this group we find some different effects
    </p>
    <p>
      The effects we can find in this group are the following
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b><a href="Effects_Macro.html">Launch a macro</a>: </b>macros are a 
        set of default effects created by the designer of the game. This 
        effect launches all the effects defined on the macro.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><a href="Effects_Cancel.html">Cancel action</a>: </b>this effect 
        cancels the default effects of default actions. Use it to avoid an 
        object being consumed automatically from the scene to execute a &quot;Take&quot; 
        action, or to avoid an object being consumed from the inventory after 
        performing a &quot;give to&quot; action.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><a href="Effects_Random.html">Effect with probability</a>: </b>allows 
        to choose between the execution of two effects depending on a 
        probability, given a percentage. Through this effect we might create 
        random behaviours on the adventures.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><a href="Effects_WaitTime.html">Wait time</a>: </b>The game action 
        stops during the specified time. Used to emphasize certain aspects of 
        the game, for example, used in combination with changes of scene, you 
        can give the user a preview of a scene without being able to interact 
        with the elements.
      </li>
    </ul>
