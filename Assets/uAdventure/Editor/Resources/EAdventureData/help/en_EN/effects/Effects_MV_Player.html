    <h1>
      Move Player effect
    </h1>
    <p>
      Through this effect we can move the player to the selected position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Create a move player effect:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Select the effect: </b>Select the effect on the creation effects 
        panel. Press OK.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Creation effect panel: </b>afterwards the next panel will appear:
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <img style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 10px; display: block; margin-bottom: 10px" src="Effects_MV_Player_files/MV_Player_effect_ES.jpg" alt="MVPLAYER EFFECT.JPG fail!">
      
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place we are allowed to select one scene of the chapter. 
      Like in other effects, the selection of the scene has the only aim of 
      previewing the scene, because the effect will be triggered in the 
      current scene. The player will move with independence of the scene 
      selected in this panel, depending only on the scene of the game where 
      the effect is triggered. Once the scene is selected, we choose the 
      position where the player will move, either fulfilling X and Y 
      coordinates or just by clicking in the position selected in the scene.
