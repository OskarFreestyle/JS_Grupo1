    <p>
      This effect reproduces an animation
    </p>
    <p>
      Create a plays animation effect:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Select the effect: </b>Select the effect on the creation effects 
        panel. Press OK.
      </li>
      <li>

    </ul>
    <img style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 10px; display: block; margin-bottom: 10px" src="Effects_Animation_files/Animation_effect_ES.jpg" alt="ANIMATION EFFECT.JPG fail!">
    

    <p>
      In the first place we find a button to select the animation. Once you 
      click &quot;Select&quot; a dialog to browes folders with a preview of selected 
      animations appears. Once the file is selected, the button &quot;View&quot; will be 
      activated, where you can also preview the animation. In this case is 
      shown in a separate window.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to delete the selected animation, you can choose another, or 
      press the red X to the left.
    </p>
    <p>
      The combo box below allows the selection of a scene. This scene is used 
      in the preview panel in the center, where the place where the animation 
      will appear can be selected. You can select the point either by clicking 
      the preview scene or changing the coordinates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the choice of a scene while editing this effect is merely 
      illustrative and does not mean that the effect will take place 
      necessarily in that scene. The effect will be implemented when carrying 
      out the action that triggers it, and will run in the scene where the 
      character is at that time.
