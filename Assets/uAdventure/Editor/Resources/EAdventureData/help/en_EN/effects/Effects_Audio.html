    <h1>
      Effect play sound
    </h1>
    <p>
      This effect reproduces a sound
    </p>
    <p>
      Create a play sound effect:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Select the effect: </b>Select the effect on the creation effects 
        panel. Press OK.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Creation effect panel: </b>afterwards the next panel will appear: <img style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 10px; display: block; margin-bottom: 10px" src="Effects_Audio_files/Audio_effect_ES.jpg" alt="AUDIO EFFECT.JPG fail!">
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In the first place we find the posibitily to play the sound in the 
      background. If this option is not activated, no action will take place 
      (launch more effects, moving the player, etc) till the sound is not 
      completely reproduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next to it we find a field to select the audio file. After pressing it, 
      in addition to the posibility of browsing the directories we can play 
      the file we select, so there is no need to leaving the application to 
      hear it. Once the file is selected, the reproduction button will be 
      active. Through this button we can also listen to the sound file.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to delete the selection of the selected file, you can choose 
      another, or press the red X to the left of the file name.
