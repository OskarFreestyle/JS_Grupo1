<h1>Show Text Effect</h1>
<p>With this effect some text is showed in the screen, as with in the conversation, but in this case the text is not associated to any character or to the protagonist. </p>
<p>Create a Show Text Effect:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Select the effect: </b>select the effect in the creation effects panel. Press OK.</li>
<li><b>Creation panel effect: </b>the next panel will appear:<img src="Effects_ShowText_files/ShowText_effect_ES.jpg" alt="SHOWTEXT EFFECT.JPG fail!" style="display:block; margin:10px"/></li>
</ul>
<p>In the first place is allowed to edit the main colour, and the border of the text which is going to be showed. When we are using any of the buttons related with this task, we can choose the scale of colors, showing the previsualization of how will fit into the text &quot;<em>This is a test line</em>&quot;.</p>
<p> Afterwards we can choose one of the existing scenes in the chaper, to see a previsualization of how the text will fit in the scene. Like with the other effects, the choice of the scene has only visualization purposes, and does not mean that the effect is related to the scene. </p>
<p>The text introduced in this effect will be showed in the scene to be executed. More at the buttom there is a text field, which will be filled with the text we want to show. The position of the text can be choosen just by clicking in the previsualization of the scene in the desired point, or just by giving values to the coordinates X and Y. In the chosen position will appear the text with the chosen colors. </p>
