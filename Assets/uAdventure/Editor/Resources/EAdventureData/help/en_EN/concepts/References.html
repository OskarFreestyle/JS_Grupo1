      References
    </h1>
    <p>
      References are used to place a character, object or atrezzo object on a 
      scene. An object can have several references, in one single scene or in 
      several and different scenes. Each reference has it own conditions, 
      which indicate when the referenced element is visible on the scene. When 
      the conditions of a reference are met or are active (or always if the 
      reference has no conditions) the element will appear on the scene. The 
      position in the scene and scale depends as well of the reference and not 
      of the referenced element, so any element can appear multiple times in 
      the same scene but in different positions and different scales.

    <h2>
      Layers system
    </h2>
    <p>
      The references uses a layer system for the painting. They will be 
      painted in the order indicated by the layers. That means that, when 
      there is more than one reference, the one in the layer X will stay in 
      front of the one in the layer Y, where Y &lt; X, and behind the one in the 
      layer Z, where Z &gt; X. The layers system gives a huge flexibility to 
      allow the creation of scenes, allowing to the create choosing when each 
      of the elements will be painted.
