    <h1>
      Actions
    </h1>
    <p>
      Actions define what can be performed over an object, character or active 
      area.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Type of actions
    </h2>
    <p>
      &quot;Examine&quot; &quot;Take&quot; (only objects and active areas) &quot;Use&quot; &quot;Custom&quot; (both 
      with one element and with two) &quot;Use with&quot; (only objects) &quot;Give to&quot; (only 
      objects) &quot;Talk to...&quot; (only characters)
    </p>
    <h2>
      Conditions
    </h2>
    <p>
      The conditions of the actions indicate when it can be performed. If the 
      conditions of the actions are not active, the action button will not be 
      drawn (unless it is an action with a default behaviour, see below).
    </p>
    <h2>
      Effects
    </h2>
    <p>
      The effect of the actions are the consequence of it being chosen by the 
      player.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Not effects
    </h2>
    <p>
      When an action has &quot;Not effects&quot; defined, it will always be available to 
      the player (even when its conditions are not met). This are the effects 
      of the action when the conditions aren't met.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Default actions
    </h2>
    <p>
      All elements have the &quot;Examine&quot; action by default, which leads the main 
      character to &quot;speak&quot; the &quot;Detailed description&quot; of the element. In 
      objects, the &quot;Grab/Use&quot; action also appears by default, and results on 
      the main character indicating that such an action cannot be performed if 
      the player choses it. The same is true for the &quot;Talk to...&quot; action with 
      NPCs. The behavior of the default actions is overwriten if any of these 
      actions is defined by the creator.
