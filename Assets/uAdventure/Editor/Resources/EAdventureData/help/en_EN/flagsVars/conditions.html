<h1>Conditions</h1>
<p>So far we have created objects, characters and scenes. However, a few objects, 
characters and scenes are not a game itself. The games must be endowed with the capacity
 of narrative, so that the &quot;history&quot; can be told. </p>
<p>In &lt;e-Adventure&gt; the development 
  of the story is governed by a few elements that we call  
  <a href="../flagsVars/flags.html" label="flags" title="flags">flags</a> and <a href="../flagsVars/variables.html" 
 label="variables" title="variables">variables</a>. The <a href="../flagsVars/flags.html" label="flags" title="flags">flags</a> 
  are a sort of &quot;locks&quot; that in a moment of the game can have two states: active and inactive.  </p>
<p>In this way we can set <a href="../flagsVars/flags.html" label="flags" title="flags">flags</a> and 
  through them conditions that either can or not be satisfied, at any given time, depending on whether 
  they are active or inactive. Furthermore, the variables can take integer values, and you can also define 
  conditions on them, depending on whether the value thereof is greater than or equal to a certain number.</p>
