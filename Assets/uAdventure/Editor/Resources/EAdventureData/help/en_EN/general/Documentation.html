<h1>Documentation</h1>
<p>The documentation consists in some text fields. Not all the elements have the same documentation, and in everyone of each elements it can behave on a different way.</p>
<p>For instance, the objects will show the name only when the player put the mouse over them on the game, they will show the description when the player click over them and the detailed description when the user examinate them (if the default behaviour has not been modified).</p>
<h2>Name</h2>
<p>The name must not be confused with the identifier. The name is used in the game, it might not be unique as the identifier, and it must be descriptive.For instance: <i>Computer</i></p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The description consists usually in a line with a brief explanation of the element. When is not compulsory to fulfill it (it will be indicated on the panel) it is because is not so often used in the enfine, and therefore the purpose is only to document the element, very useful if in the game development there are more persons, or if it must be modified later on.For instance: <i>This is a computer</i></p>
<h2>Detailed description</h2>
<p>The detailed description is a more extended description. We have to notice that in the game this can be said by the player, and therefore is recommended to be written as the other conversations.Por example: <i>This is a computer, I could used it to search on the internet if they borrow me it, but I am not sure about that point...</i></p>
