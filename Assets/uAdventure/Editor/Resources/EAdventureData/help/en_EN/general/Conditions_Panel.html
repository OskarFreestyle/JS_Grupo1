<h1>Conditions panel</h1>
<p>In the conditions panel we can find a first part of it which details the conditions which are being edited. After that there is a bigger one where we can edit the conditions. In addition there is a button to add new conditions and accept the changes. <img src="./Conditions_Panel_files/conditionsPanel1.png" style="display:block; margin:10px"/></p>
<h2>Top part: description of the condition</h2>
<p>At this part of the panel we will find a brief description which corresponds to the condition we are editing.</p>
<h2>Bottom part: add conditions and accept changes</h2>
<p>At this part of the panel we will find two buttons. Through them we can add new conditions or just accept the changes introduced to the conditions we are editing, and closing the window.</p>
<h2>The edition panel</h2>
<p>In this panel we will find a very graphic description of the condition we are implementing.
  When we put the pointer over a condition we have the next following posibilities:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <i>Remove</i>: remove the condition. </li>
  <li><i>Duplicate</i>: creates a new condition just like the actual one, and afterwards the aforementioned condition joint by an "or". </li>
  <li><i>Edite</i>: edits the content of the condition. We can change the evaluated element or the value which is being compared as well.
    el valor con el que se compara.</li>
  <li>When we put the pointer over a connection we can edit the value, which can oscillate between <i>"AND"</i> and <i>"OR"</i>. The conditions will be groupped automatically depending on the meaning they have in the e-Adventure language.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Some other things...</h3>
<p>When we add a condition, this will be added after the all existing conditions. If we want to add a condition in the middle position the best way to achieve this is chosing the previous condition to the place we want to insert the new one, duplicate it, and afterwards modificating the value of the new created condition.</p>
