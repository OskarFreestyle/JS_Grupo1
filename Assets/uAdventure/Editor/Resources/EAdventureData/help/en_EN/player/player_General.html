<h1>Player</h1>
<p>The <span class="concepto">Player</span> is the main character controlled by the user.</p>
<p>If it is a <span class="referencia_literal">third person</span> adventure we'll see him drawn into the screen and we'll be able to move him all arround.</p>
<p>If it is a <span class="referencia_literal">first person</span> adventure <span class="concepto">Player</span> won't have a physical representation. Screen game will be what the <span class="concepto">Player</span> sees through his eyes.</p>
<p> Only if it is a<span class="referencia_literal"> third person</span> adventure, we could define his <a href="player_Appearance.html">appearance</a>.</p>
