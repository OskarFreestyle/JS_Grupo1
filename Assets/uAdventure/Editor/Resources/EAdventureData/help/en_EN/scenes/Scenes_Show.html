<h1>Scene: Show</h1>
<p>In this column we can decide if we want or not to show the scene at the bottom panel.</p>
<p>When the field is already selected, the scene will be visible in the panel, and where it is not, we will not see the panel. This configuration remains when the project is closed and opened again, and when move through the tabs.</p>
