<h1>Scene: Appearence</h1>
<p>In this panel we can set up the appearence of the scene, particularly its background.</p>
<h2>Background image of the scene</h2>
<p><b>Compulsory</b></p>
<p>This is the image to be shown like background of the scene. It must have a minimum size or 800x600, and it is recommended to avoid a height of 600.</p>
<h2>Front Mask of the scene</h2>
<p><b>Optional</b></p>
<p>It consist on drawing a black and white image, which indicate us which parte of the bckground image will be drawn in front or behind the objects. We can see here a background image, and its attached frontal mask:</p>
<p> <img style="display:block; margin:10px"  src="Scene_Appearence_files/mask.jpg" alt="Ejemplo de uso de m&aacute;scara frontal"/></p>
<p>As we can see, it is a classroom image. Its easy to guess that, for this image, the characters should situate just behind the tables (on the frontground) but in front of the blackboard. So on the front mask images the tables appear in black color.</p>
<p>The frontal masks are dying out due to the usage complexity and limitations they have. As it will be described later on, this behaviour can be made (and in a much more fashion style) combining both layers and atrezzo objects</p>
<h2>Background music</h2>
<p><b>Optional</b></p>
<p>Background music, which will be cyclically playes while the scene is on the screen. MP3 and MIDI formats are accepted.</p>
