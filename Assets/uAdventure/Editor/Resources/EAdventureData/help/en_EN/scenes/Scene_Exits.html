<h1>Scene: exists</h1>
<p> The exits are the main element in order to allow the player to move from one scene to another. The exit are created on the scene, usually occupying an area which in  the background image symbolizes a door or something similar. The exit can be rectangular or polygonal.</p>
<p>Each exit leads to a different scene, but you can set up two exits on the same position that lead to different scenes and each one is active with different <a href="...">conditions</a></p>
<p>For each exit a scene is defined below (See information on the <a href="...">Next Stage</a> column), we can define a transition (See information on the <a href="...">Transition</a> column), you can change the appearance (See information on the <a href="...">Appearence</a> column) and can modify their conditions and effects (See information on the column <a href="...">Conditions</a> and <a href="...">Effects</a>)</p>
