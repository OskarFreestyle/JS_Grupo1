<ul>
  <li><b>Select the effect: </b>Select the effect on the creation effects panel. Press OK.</li>
  <li><b>Creation effect panel: </b>afterwards an edition panel will appear:<p>
  In the first place we find the posibitily to play the sound on the background. If this option is not activated, no action will take place (launch more effects, moving the player, etc) till the sound is not completely reproduced.
