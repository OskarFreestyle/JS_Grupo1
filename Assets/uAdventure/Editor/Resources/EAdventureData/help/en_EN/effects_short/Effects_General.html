<body><h1>Effects</h1>
<p>In order to control the state of the game we use flags, variables and global states. They are used to add some conditions to some elements of the games dependending on the actual value. On this way we define concrete situations in the games, specifying what must appear on the scene, which actions we might be able to perform, etc.</p>
<p>Through the effects we can change the state of the flags and variables, modifying the
  concrete states in the game. This happen cause the changes on some flags and variables
  allow changing conditions. We can find those effects on the &quot;Game State&quot; group.</p>
<p>Besides, we can find the next effects groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Multimedia:</b> effects which allow us to show multimedia elements, like audio and video.
<li><b>Notification:</b> effects to notify the user information on some different several ways, like a phrase of one of the characters, a book or a conversation.</li>
<li><b>Trigger event:</b> those effects will trigger some events, like a change of scene.</li>

effects involving any change in the current scene, as the movement of characters or collection of objects..</li>
