<h1>Plays animation effect</h1>
<p>This effect reproduces an animation</p>
<p>Create a plays animation effect:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Select the effect: </b>Select the effect on the creation effects panel. Press OK.</li>
  <li><b>Creation effect panel: </b>afterwards an edition panel will appear:
<p>
  In the first place we find a button to select the animation. Once you click, plus the ability to browse directories there is a preview in the same window. Once the file is selected the button &quot;View&quot; will be activated, where you can also preview the animation. In this case is shown in a separate window.</p>
<p>If you want to delete the selection of the selected file, you can choose another, or press the red X below the path of the file.</p>
<p>We also found a drop-down panel (just below the commentary). On it we can choose a scene, which is previewed in the current window. Now we can choose a point on the screen where the chosen animation will be reproduced, either by filling in the X and Y coordinates, or by clicking an item. Note that the choice of a scene while editing this effect is merely illustrative and does not mean that the effect will take place necessarily in that scene. The effect will be implemented when carrying out the action that triggers it, and will run in the scene where the character is at that time.</p></ul>
