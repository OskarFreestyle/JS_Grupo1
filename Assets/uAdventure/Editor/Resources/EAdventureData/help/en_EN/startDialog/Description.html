<p><b>Welcome to the eAdventure editor! </b> To get started using the editor you must choose between the options prompted here.
  You can create a new file by clicking on the button you can find below. 
  You are allowed to create two different type of adventure games (this choice can be modified later):
<ul>
  <li>Adventures where the player is shown normally, as for instance, the MonkeyIslandTM saga (3rd person mode).</li>
  <li>Adventures where the player is not shown, giving the impression that the user is directly inside the game, as in the Myst saga (1st person mode).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not want to create a new adventure project, you can open an existing one by browsing the tabs above.</p>
