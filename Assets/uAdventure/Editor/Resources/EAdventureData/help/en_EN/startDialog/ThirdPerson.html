<body><p><b>Third person adventure</b>
 You have selected to create a new adventure in 3rd person mode (player is visible).
The player is represented by an avatar, which is drawn onto the game all the time. 
It needs some time to go from place to place, and when he speaks the text is displayed just over his head.
