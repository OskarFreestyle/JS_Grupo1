    <h1>
      Adaptation Rules
    </h1>
    <p>
      The adaptation rules have a set of properties that must be fulfilled in 
      the LMS in order for the actions associated with the rule to be 
      executed. The above mentioned actions follow the same idea that the <a href="../adaptation/adaptationInitialState.html" label="initial state" title="initial state">initial 
      state</a>, meaning that when the properties in LMS (defined in &quot;LMS 
      State&quot; tab) are fulfilled the rules will be executed. The rules have an 
      associated initial state (in this case it is showed at right of the rule 
      description in the table of rules). When the rule is run, it will 
      updated the variables and the flags that appear in the tab &quot;Game State&quot; 
      in the low part of the screen (once we have selected one particular 
      rule).
    </p>
    <p>
      It is necessary to emphasize that only the last fulfilled rule will be 
      executed, considering the last one the one that is in the low part of 
      rules list.
