    <h1>
      Adaptation Profile
    </h1>
    <p>
      The way of generating the adaptation profiles is very similar to the 
      generation of <a title="assessment profiles" label="assessment profiles" href="../assessment/assessmentProfile.html">assessment 
      profiles</a>. Adaptation profiles are used to adapt (modifiy) the game 
      based on a set of &quot;external properties&quot; regarding the users coming from 
      the server (e.g. state of the LMS, Learning Managemente System).
    </p>
    <p>
      When these properties are fulfilled at the beginning of the chapter a 
      set of flags and initial variables are activated or deactivated 
      automatically and the first scene changes (if desired). So, it is 
      possible to change the number of available objects, adapt the difficulty 
      according to the student profile, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also these external properties can be empty in order to make changes in 
      game automatically at startup. This way it is possible to provide 
      differents version of the game simply by changing the adaptation profile 
      associated with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the same way that in assessment profiles, the type of adapatation 
      profile must be set as SCORM 2004 or SCORM v1.2 if we are going to make 
      an exportation of these types. If you select any type, a list will 
      appear in the attribute &quot;Id&quot; of the state of the unit of learning with 
      the parts of the SCORM data model which are available.
