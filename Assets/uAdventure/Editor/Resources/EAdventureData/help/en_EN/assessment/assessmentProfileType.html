      Profile Type
    </h1>
    <p>
      Due to the fact that different e-learning standards are supported, 
      different evaluation and assessment profiles can be defined. The choice 
      of profile is related to the data model which is going to be exchanged 
      with the LMS and different restrictions apply depending on the standard 
      or specification. There are three profile types available:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Normal Profile</b>

        <p>
          There are not restrictions in LMS data model in this kind of profile 
          and it is used for those standards that have no specific data model 
          (such as Learning Desing)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Scrom v1.2 Profile</b>

        <p>
          Limits the data model to the SCORM 1.2 specification. The properties 
          that can be consulted or modified in assessment or evaluation 
          profiles are only those available in the specification. This 
          prevents the modification or access to values that are not part of 
          the data model or that do not support that particular behavior. At 
          the same time, this helps users unfamiliar with the details of the 
          data model by forcing the correct use of its values. When a game is 
          to be exported as SCORM 1.2, both the selected assessment and the 
          selected evaluation profiles must be of the SCORM 1.2 type.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Scorm 2004 Profile</b>

        <p>
          It operates in the same way that for the SCORM 1.2 specification, 
          but using the data model of the SCORM 2004 specification. When a 
          game is to be export as SCORM 2004 or as AGREGA (the games exported 
          to AGREGA are SCORM 2004 compatible), both the assessment and 
          evaluation profiles selected for the chapter must be of this type.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
