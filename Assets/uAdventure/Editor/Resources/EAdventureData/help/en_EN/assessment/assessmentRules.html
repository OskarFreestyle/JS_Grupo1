      Assessment rules
    </h1>
    <p>
      To edit an assessment rule it must be selected on the rules list. New 
      rules can be also added following these <a title="Tablas" href="../general/Tables.html">instructions</a>. 
      The next fields can be edited in an assessment rule:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="AssessmentRules_Files/assessmentRules2.jpg" alt="ASSESSMENT RULES.JPG fail!">
      
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Importance: </b>This field accepts one of the next values (from 
        lowest to highest): <em>Very low, low, normal, high and very high</em>. 
        By default the rule will be given the &quot;normal&quot; value. When an 
        assessment report is generated manually by the student (using the 
        appropriate option on the game menu) he or she can select the 
        importance threshold. In this manner, the student will only get the 
        feedback that he or she considers relevant.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Concept:</b> Brief textual description of what the rule aims to 
        evaluate. This field will be written onto the assessment report using 
        a <b>bold</b> font.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Conditions: </b>The set of conditions (over flags and variables) 
        that must be satisfied to trigger the rule. The game author can modify 
        the values of those flags and variables by triggering appropriate 
        effects when the student performs any action that deserves evaluation 
        and/or feedback. For instance, the game author may decide to activate 
        a flag when a student fails on the achievement of a game task, and use 
        that flag to trigger an assessment rule that subtracts some points 
        from the final score of the student. (for more information see <a title="Condiciones" label="Condiciones" href="../general/Conditions.html">conditions</a>)
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Text: </b>Complete text description of the concept that triggered 
        the assessment rule. This field will be written onto the assessment 
        report just behind the concept, but using a normal font size. It will 
        typically contain detailed information about what the student did 
        right or wrong, and what should the correct answer be.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Properties: </b>Each property is a pair of the form &lt;key, value&gt;. 
        When the rule is satisfied the key will be assigned the value 
        specified. These properties can be sent to a central Learning 
        Management System (LMS) such as Moodle or Sakai for processing and 
        attachment to the student's profile. Therefore the values of these 
        properties will not be printed on the assessment report that the 
        student will see. They can be used to define global or partial scores 
        for the student, or to indicate the LMS what are the learning 
        outcomes. If the profile is based on SCORM the keys will be the fields 
        specified by the CMI data model (More info in: <a title="Tipo de perfil" label="Tipo de perfil" href="assessmentProfileType.html">Profile 
        Type</a>).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>
      Timed Assessment Rules
    </h1>
    <p>
      These rules have an associated timer that will start timing when the <b>init 
      conditions</b> are met. The timer is stopped when the <b>end conditions</b> 
      are satisfied. The game author can define different effects to be 
      triggered depending on the elapsed time. Each effect will be assigned a 
      time range, so if the elapsed time fits within a time range the 
      corresponding effect will be triggered. The effect is compounded by the <b>text</b> 
      and the <b>&lt;key, value&gt; list </b>as for normal assessment rules. 
      If the elapsed time does not fit in any of the time ranges defined, no 
      action is performed. If the elapsed time fits in two or more different 
      ranges, the effect defined for the first one will be triggered (note 
      that time ranges do not need to be disjoint).
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      In this manner game authors can define evaluations that depend on the 
      time that the student invests in completing the tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, both the normal and timed assessment rules can be used to 
      generate a human-readable HTML report (like the one below), devised for 
      the student, or an XML machine-readable report, designed for the LMS.
